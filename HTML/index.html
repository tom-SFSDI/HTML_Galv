    <h1>Cities I have lived in either previously or currently.</h1>
    <ul>
        <li>Chicago, IL</li>
        <li>Bloomington, IL</li>
        <li>McKinney, TX</li>
    </ul>
    <p>I grew up in Chicago, but moved to Bloomington when I got a job with XX. There is a neighborhood in McKinney that is very popular with photographers, known as Adriatica. It has a unique mediterranian village look to it. I will add a photo of the area
        as well as a youtube video about life in McKinney in case you are interested.</p>

    <h2>Cities that I would like to travel to one day.</h2>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>London, UK</strong></li>
        <span>&nbsp;</span>
        <li><em>Paris, FR</em></li>
        <span>&nbsp;</span>
        <li><strong>Tokyo, JP</strong></li>
        <span>&nbsp;</span>
    </ol>
    <p>I actually visited London in March of 2020, but due to covid turning the world upside down the trip wasn't as productive as it could have been. I also added Paris, which I was supposed to go to in March of 2020, but was unable to due to Covid travel
        restrictions which would have prevented me from returning to the US as scheduled. I added Tokyo, because it would be an interesting place to visit.
