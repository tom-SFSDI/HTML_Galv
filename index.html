    <h1>Cities I have lived in either previously or currently.</h1>
    <ul>
        <li>Chicago, IL</li>
        <li>Bloomington, IL</li>
        <li>McKinney, TX</li>
    </ul>
    <p>I grew up in Chicago. I moved to Bloomington when I got a job. I moved to McKinney when I was relocated for a new position.

    <h2>Cities that I would like to travel to one day.</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>London, UK</li>
        <li>Paris, FR</li>
        <li>Tokyo, JP</li>
    </ol>
    <p>I actually visited London in March of 2020, but due to covid turning the world upside down the trip wasn't as productive as it could have been. I also added Paris, which I was supposed to go to in March of 2020, but was unable to due to Covid travel
        restrictions, as well as Tokyo. I just think Tokyo would be an interesting place to see.
